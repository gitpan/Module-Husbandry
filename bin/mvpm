END_USAGE
    description => <<END_DESCRIPTION
Renames one or more modules.  Changes all occurences of that module's
package name in all files under the current directory.

Backups of any files to be changed are placed in .mvpm/back_0001
(where the 0001 is incremented each time), so you should be able to
remove (manually) any new files and restore the old ones.

TODO: The "or more" part (the -r option).

TODO: Generate patch files for backups to make rollback easier.

TODO: Generate patch files instead of acting, to allow a user to
edit the patch file to determine what not to change by deleting or
altering chunks.

Limitations

Does not remove newly empty directories.

Will misfire when handed source module names that match other
words in the source files:  mvpm a b would also change all
occurences of the word "a" in all files under ., for instance.
